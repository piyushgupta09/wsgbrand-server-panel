                platform, make a purchase on one of our platforms, or use any of our services in any other way. We
                combine PII collected from you on the platform with PII obtained from third parties, which include our
                credible business partners and social media platforms.  Your browsing information automatically gets collected when you visit our
                platform.. This type of browsing data is associated with an anonymous IP identifier and is not
                associated with you personally. If this browsing information is linked to information that can be used
                to personally identify you, we will treat it as PII.  Every so often, you may provide us with, and we may collect from you,
                third-party PII (for instance, for delivery purposes). It is your duty to ensure that any third-party
                PII you provide us with is aware of: a) this Privacy Policy; and b) the fact that you are sharing their
                PII with us.  While you have the option of using a pseudonym or remaining anonymous when
                dealing with us, doing so may thwart us from providing you with products and services or for other
                purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This is especially applicable when you buy goods online or
                need them delivered to your registered postal address.  You are not required to provide any PII to us; however, if you do not, we will
                not be in a situation to provide you with the products, or services, or benefits requested by you.  For the purposes of this Policy, any information you share about yourself,
                whether PII or not, in an open public forum – in user-generated content elements of our platform, on a
                social network – will be considered public information. Although we value and sometimes request your
                feedback, it is best not to post it if you are not comfortable with the feedback getting public.  Who Collects Information?   When you interact with us via our platform, call centres, associated entities,
                service providers, applications, our website, or mobile website, we collect information from you. We may
                also obtain information about you from third parties, such as social media platforms or our trusted
                business partners, who gather information from you on our behalf in order to assist us in operating our
                platform and providing services of interest to you. We may obtain your PII from third parties who choose
                to share it with us. Please also consider our dependable business partners. Third-party advertising companies are also allowed to collect your browsing
                information in order to provide ads tailored to your interests on our behalf. For further information on
                interest-based ads and your options regarding your data, see the "Interest-Based Advertising Section"
                below.  When you interact with us through our platform, we may collect information in
                a variety of ways. It may be gathered in obvious, active ways, such as when you make a purchase when you
                provide your details, such as name and address or other information when using the customer service chat
                feature, when entering a contest or sweepstakes, or when uploading a photo or product review to our
                platform. It may also be collected in a passive manner or automatically when you visit and navigate our
                platform via cookies and web beacons, which capture your browsing information and allow us and
                third-party advertising companies to better customize content and advertising to you.  In general, the collection of your PII, browsing information, and information
                you post or provide may differ depending on the purpose, functionality, or unique aspects of our

                discussing, disclosing, or using such PII for any purpose other than providing us with the services for
                which we have contracted. We might disclose your browsing information and additional information that
                does not include your PII to third parties. In such cases, however, your information is aggregated with

                in ways that are irreconcilable with the purposes for which it was initially collected or subsequently
                authorized by you.  We may share personally identifiable information and browsing data: · within our family of brands and businesses that control, are controlled by,
                or are under common control with Urbanic; · with our service providers, which include deliveries, couriers, internet
                service providers, IT system administrators, promotions firms, marketing consultants, payment
                processors, mailing houses, and other third-party suppliers with whom we do business; · with our professional advisors and consultants; · with our call centres and associated entities.   These parties follow their own privacy policies that govern the way they
                handle PII. If Urbanic or one of its associated entities is sold, merged, or acquired, or
                if we transfer some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer PII and browsing information as
                part of that transaction. You will have the option to opt-out of any such transfer if, in our opinion,
                it will result in the handling of your personally identifiable information in a manner that is

                marketing purposes or otherwise use your details in a way that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
                In that case, we will first obtain your consent.  Job Applicants If you are considering employment opportunities in our company, we may collect

                take reasonable steps to correct that information, unless a local law exemption applies.  Feel free to write to us at any time to request to make amendments in certain

                of the third-party advertising companies that use cookies on our platform to provide interest-based
                advertising allow you to opt-out of those practices. If you want to learn more about interest-based
                advertising and see what options you have regarding how companies use your information, please visit http://aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ . Neither do we control nor operate these websites, nor are we responsible for
                the opt-out options available on them. The only way to completely avoid online tracking is to configure
                your browser to turn down cookies or to notify you whenever a cookie is set. Please keep in mind that
                even if you opt out of interest-based advertising on or through http://www.networkadvertising.org or
                other sites or services, you may still be receiving marketing material from us because interest-based
                advertising is only one type of advertising. As stated above, you have the option to opt-out of receiving any marketing
                materials from us.   At last, it is important to note that in most cases, opting out results in the
                placement of an "opt-out cookie" on your browser. Subsequently, if you delete, block, or otherwise
                restrain cookies or use a different computer or browser, you must renew your opt-out preference.  Controlling Cookies Because cookies and web beacons are the technologies that are generally used
                to collect browsing information, you can block cookies to control data collection related to
                interest-based advertising. Typically, you can do so through your browser. Check the technical
                information for your browser for instructions. Preventing your browser from accepting cookies precludes
                the collection of your browsing information for the purpose of delivering interest-based advertisements.
                It may, however, disable or interfere with shopping features on our sites and other sites that you
                visit. Cookies, for example, enable us to save your shopping cart selections when you navigate away from
                the order page and then return to it. When you return to our sites, cookies allow us to recognize you as
                an account holder. Most browsers automatically accept cookies.  Interacting with Social Media on our Platform  Many of our customers use and enjoy the tools provided by social media, and we
                include links to several social media platforms on our platform. If you use our platform to interact
                with these social media tools, your experience on those social media sites will be subject to the
                privacy and other policies of those platforms. The extent to which your information is made public will
                be determined by the privacy settings you have selected on those sites. You are advised to adjust your
                privacy settings on those sites accordingly.  Links Links to other websites may be found on our platform. A link to any of the
                third-party websites does not imply that we support or are affiliated with it. We have no control over
                third-party websites. You use such third-party websites or content entirely at your own risk. Before
                providing any information to a third-party website, you should always read its privacy policy.  Additional privacy policies may apply in cases where we run promotions or make
                special offers. You are always recommended to check to see if any additional privacy provisions apply.  Children   Our platform is only available to people who can form legally binding
                contracts under the Indian Contract Act of 1872. Persons who are deemed \'incompetent to contract\' under
                the Indian Contract Act of 1872, including minors, are ineligible to use our platform. A minor (any
                person under the age of 18 is defined as a minor) should not use, access, or transact on our platform.
                If a minor wishes to use, transact, or provide PII on our platform, such PII must be provided by a legal
                guardian or parents.  Furthermore, we do not intentionally collect PII from children under the age
                of 18. If we find out that we have received PII inadvertently from a child who is below the age of 18
                years, we will instantly delete that information from our system.  DATA INTEGRITY   We keep your PII confidential, and by contract, we require each of our trusted
                business partners who may have access to such PII to do the same. In turn, our trusted business partners
                may share information with their own service providers under similar confidentiality restrictions.  We will not under any situation sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any of your
                PII to any of our third-party without first obtaining your permission. Outside parties do not include
                Urbanic India-owned businesses or our trusted business partners who assist us in operating and providing
                services on our platform.  Of course, we reserve the right to make a disclosure if we reasonably believe
                it is required by law, to enforce our platform policies, or to protect your or others\' rights, property,
                or safety.  Safeguarding Your PII  Your Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and any other information that
                we collected is processed in strict compliance with the Indian Information Technology Act, 2000, and the
                rules promulgated thereunder. While processing, storing or handling any Personal detail or Sensitive
